# PIVOT_ARM
PLC (Ladder Logic) based sorting system project that uses two diffuse sensors and pivot arm sorter equipped with a belt to automate the system using TIA portal V15, Factory I/O. The system consists of a conveyor belt to carry all the products, another conveyor belt to carry the products deviated by the pivot arm and its belt and two diffuse sensors, the system now utilizes the pivot arm sorter and its belt to deviate the larger products onto the other conveyor belt. The diffuse sensor is used to identify any product passing in front of it on the conveyor belt. As soon as the upper diffuse sensor senses a product, the sensor passes a specific signal to the PLC which in turn operates the pivot arm and its belt to deviate products onto the other conveyor belt. So this way we have developed the fully automated pivot arm sorting system.
